This assignment took about 14 hours. 4 or 5 of those hours were spent trying to figure
out how the assignment worked. 

I thought that the assignment was a very good one but was hurt by the lack of guidance.
I think it would have been great to maybe have the recitation sections go over what the
surrounding code was doing before we actually had to code anything. Would have saved a
ton of time.
