# Programming-Languages-Coursework
Functional Programming (2015)

This is a repsitory hosting my coursework for my programming languages class. The languages used in this repository were:
Impcore(made up for course), C, scheme, and standard ML. This course was about learning first hand the recurring concepts 
that go into developing programming languages.

Particular emphasis was placed on the concepts of functional programming, and type cheking. HW6 was an assignment where a type
checker was built for a statically typed version of the language scheme.
