I collaborated with Janeth on this assignment

I solved every problem except for 23

I think I did well on every dimension excpet for the Correctness of Question 23

I spent about 15 hours on this assignment. 6 of those hours were spent on question 23
and I finally gave up because there were no TA's. Could have used a bit more guidance 
on question 23. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was even going on.
